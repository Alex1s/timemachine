# /dev/sda is the storage device, on my Raspberry PI is only one stoage device of sd* type connected, so it will always be /dev/sda
# /mnt/timemachine is the folder the storage device will be mounted to
# ext4 is the file system the storage device is using
# default: the defaults, dont know the details
# nofail: dont prevent the os from booting if storage is not plugged in
# x-systemd.device-timeout=10s try to mount device for this long and then give up and continue booting
# X-mount.mkdir create the /mnt/6393F356310B86A0 folder if it does not exist yet
# the zero: is checked by the dump(8) utility. This field is usually set to 0, which disables the check. (source: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fstab)
# the two: sets the order for file system checks at boot time; see fsck(8). For the root device it should be 1. For other partitions it should be 2, or 0 to disable checking. (source: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fstab)
